## Getting Started

* Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* Clone or [download](https://github.com/jhoelzl/vagrant-magento-setup/archive/master.zip) this repository to the root of your project directory `git clone https://github.com/jhoelzl/vagrant-magento-setup`
* In your project directory, run `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh`

The first time you run this, Vagrant will download the bare Ubuntu box image. This can take a little while as the image is a few-hundred Mb. This is only performed once.
